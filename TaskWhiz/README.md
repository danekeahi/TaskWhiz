This is TaskWhiz. In all of the task management webapps that I've used, none of them has done me any good. Todoist is simple, but I wish I would be able to see what I have to do in a weekly format, so I can balance out my workload. Notion is able to do this, but it's too hard to get started with it. Google Docs would be an easier option because of how user-friendly the interface is, but it's hard to make it look good. As a result, I bring you TaskWhiz.

TaskWhiz is a user-friendly, sleek, and simple task management webapp. And the best part about it: You can drag and drop tasks into different days of the week.

To get started, download the zipfile and open it up in cs50.dev. Type "cd task" into your terminal and enter. Then, type "flask run" and enter. Open the link, and welcome to TaskWhiz! Once you're in, you will have to register/log in but this is necessary to save your tasks. When you're done with that, simply type a task that needs to get done into the textbox. Then, set a priority (optional) to indicate how important it is that you get this task done. Finally, add that task to the task box below, and you will see it pop up with a button to indicate completion on its left and the priority on its right.

Now, for the best part, you can drag and drop that task into a day-of-the-week! Simply, aim your mouse anywhere in the box with you task name in it, and drag it to any day-of-the-week. You should try and aim the middle of the task name to the desired day-of-the-week box in order to make sure you're not putting the task in another day. And that's it! You can now easily organize all the tasks you need to get done for each week using TaskWhiz, making you a better student!
